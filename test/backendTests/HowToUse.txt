The tests in this folder can be run in this way:
- In DatabaseHelper set a new database version (preferably from 100)
- replace main.dart with content of the MainToTest.dart
- copy the all tests from the test sets into main.dart line 50
- start the main application and press on the button in the middle of screen
- all tests should be passed!
- revert the main.dart to original file and reset the database version to the original version
